Installation
------------

Make sure you have all the following libraries:
- IPython
- simplejson
- rpyc


Make sure your PYTHONPATH includes this pyreg directory.



Usage
-----

1. Run the supervisor server. The -i is needed to keep it open.
	$ python -i proc_server.py


2. In another tab, run the test script with an rpyc_server. You'll get an ipython shell after test.py completes.
	$ python -m rpyc_run test.py


3. Open test.html in a browser. Documentation takes over from there.
