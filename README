Make sure your PYTHONPATH includes this pyreg directory.


Usage

0. If you're using Chrome Beta, websockets are supported. Otherwise, you need to use flash and run the socket server. You need superuser to open port 843 on Mac.
	$ perl -T socketpolicy/socketpolicy.pl

1. Run the server and the test script
	$ python -m ajax_run test.py

2. Open test.html in a browser. Documentation takes over from there.
